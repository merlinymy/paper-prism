# Backend Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for batch operations and maintenance tasks.

## Batch DOI Extraction and Metadata Update

`batch_extract_doi_metadata.py` - Automatically extracts DOIs from PDFs and updates paper metadata using CrossRef API.

### Features

- Extracts DOIs from PDF files that don't have one stored
- Fetches accurate metadata from CrossRef (title, authors, year, journal)
- Updates papers with poor metadata quality
- Generates proper filenames in "Author-YEAR-Title.pdf" format
- Rate limiting (1 request/second by default) to respect CrossRef API limits
- Progress tracking and detailed logging
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Error handling and recovery

### Requirements

```bash
# Make sure you're in the backend virtual environment
cd /Users/merlin/Dev/paper-prism/backend
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# The script uses only standard library + requests (already installed)
```

### Usage

**Important**: Make sure your backend server is running before executing the script!

```bash
# Start the backend server (in another terminal)
cd /Users/merlin/Dev/paper-prism/backend
source venv/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

Then run the script:

```bash
# Dry run first (recommended) - see what would be updated without making changes
python scripts/batch_extract_doi_metadata.py --dry-run

# Actually process all papers
python scripts/batch_extract_doi_metadata.py

# Use custom API URL (if backend is on different port)
python scripts/batch_extract_doi_metadata.py --api-url http://localhost:8080

# Custom rate limit (e.g., 2 seconds between CrossRef requests)
python scripts/batch_extract_doi_metadata.py --rate-limit 2.0
```

### What It Does

The script processes each paper and:

1. **Checks if processing is needed**:
   - Skips papers that already have DOI and good metadata
   - Processes papers with missing DOI, authors, or poor titles

2. **Extracts DOI** (if missing):
   - Scans PDF metadata
   - Searches first page for DOI patterns
   - Validates and normalizes the DOI

3. **Fetches metadata from CrossRef**:
   - Queries CrossRef REST API with the DOI
   - Extracts title, authors, publication year, and journal
   - Respects rate limits (1 second between requests by default)

4. **Updates paper metadata**:
   - Updates title if current is "Unknown" or poor quality
   - Updates authors if current is empty
   - Updates year if missing
   - Generates proper filename: `LastName-YEAR-Title.pdf`

### Rate Limits

CrossRef API officially allows up to 50 requests per second, but we use a conservative default of **1 request per second** to:
- Be a good API citizen
- Avoid potential rate limiting
- Ensure reliability

You can adjust this with `--rate-limit` if needed, but don't go below 0.5 seconds.

### Error Handling

The script handles errors gracefully:
- **DOI not found**: Logs warning and continues
- **CrossRef 404**: Logs that DOI doesn't exist in CrossRef
- **Network errors**: Logs error and continues to next paper
- **Keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)**: Shows partial progress and exits cleanly

### Tips

1. **Always dry-run first**: Use `--dry-run` to see what would be changed
2. **Monitor progress**: The script logs detailed progress every 10 papers
3. **Run during off-hours**: Processing many papers can take time (1-2 seconds per paper)
4. **Check logs**: Review the output for any papers that had errors
5. **Re-run if needed**: The script is idempotent - safe to run multiple times

### Troubleshooting

**"Connection refused" error**:
- Make sure the backend server is running on the specified port
- Check the `--api-url` parameter matches your backend

**"DOI not found" warnings**:
- Some PDFs don't contain DOIs - this is normal
- You can manually add DOIs through the UI

**Rate limit errors from CrossRef**:
- Increase the `--rate-limit` parameter (e.g., `--rate-limit 2.0`)
- Wait a few minutes and try again

**Many "No metadata improvements available"**:
- This means your papers already have good metadata!
- The script only updates when it can improve quality
