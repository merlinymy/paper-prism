"""HyDE - Hypothetical Document Embeddings.

Instead of embedding the user query directly, HyDE:
1. Generates a hypothetical answer to the query using an LLM
2. Embeds the hypothetical answer
3. Searches for real documents similar to the hypothetical answer

This often produces better retrieval because the hypothetical answer
is closer to actual document content than a short query.
