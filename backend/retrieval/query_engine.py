1. FIRST: Answer the question using ONLY the retrieved sources. Cite every claim with [Source N] format.
2. THEN: After fully addressing the question with source citations, you may add:

## Additional Context (General Knowledge)

In this section, clearly indicate that this information comes from your general training knowledge, not the uploaded papers. Use phrases like:
- "Based on general scientific knowledge..."
- "From broader literature (not in uploaded papers)..."
- "General background that may be relevant..."

2. **Retrieved source chunks** from RAG (pre-identified relevant sections)

**CRITICAL: You MUST cite the retrieved sources using [Source N] format throughout your response.**

- The retrieved source chunks (RAG) are pre-identified relevant sections that directly address the query
- The full PDFs provide broader context, additional details, and sections not captured in the RAG chunks
- **Always start by thoroughly addressing the question using the retrieved source chunks with [Source N] citations**
- You may then draw on the full PDFs to provide additional context, figures, methods details, or related information not in the RAG chunks
- When referencing information from the PDFs that is NOT in the retrieved sources, clearly indicate this (e.g., "From the broader paper context..." or "As shown in the full document...")
- Cross-reference between RAG chunks and full PDFs to provide comprehensive, well-cited answers

This dual approach allows you to provide highly relevant cited information (from RAG) while having access to the complete paper context (from PDFs)."""
